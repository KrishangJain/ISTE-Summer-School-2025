# ISTE-Summer-School-2025
# Cyber Security
# Final Task

The following tasks were assigned:

    Inside the repo, write markdown (.md) writeups for at least 3 of your favorite picoCTF challenges that you solved during the summer school.

    You can pick any challenges from picoCTF — especially the ones we discussed in sessions, or any others you tried on your own.

    What to Include in Each Writeup:
    For each challenge, briefly explain:

    The challenge name and category (Web, Crypto, Reverse, etc.)

    Your thought process and how you approached it

    Tools or techniques you used

    Final steps to solve it (with commands, code, or screenshots if needed)

    These don’t have to be long — just enough to show your understanding.

Solution for the task has been uploaded.
